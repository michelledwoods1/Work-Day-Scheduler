- relevant jquery code - equivilant to javascript code
- how to access Bootstrap code and use
- how to access Moment code and use
- a refresher on parseInt
- that you can use variables in the localStorage.setItem and .getItem   and that you can use the if function to create multiple keys
- the importance of attributes in calling all same elements
#
## Steps Taken

- #### Step 1 - Create draft README, html, script.js, style css

- #### Step 2 - Incorrectly used hard coding html and css, before realising it is a jquery/Bootstrap/Moment assignment

- #### Step 3 - Create variables for existing html/css

- #### Step 4 - Creat variable for new elements

- #### Step 5 - Ceate for loop to dynamically create the individual components each for for each hour of the working day

- #### Step 6 - Create if function to check if the actual hour of the day is the same as the scheduld hours and assign past/present/future color configurations

- #### Step 7 - Create click event on the button element set local storage with time and text values, create message and timeout

- #### Step 8 - Recall local storage using a for loop for all hours in the day
